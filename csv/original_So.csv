Here at Frontier, we help companies grow full-time, cross-functional teams
abroad. We hire the smartest people, and we place them into the best
companies. In three years, we've never lost a client.

If you like one of the Frontier roles, and you apply, and you're accepted,

    * Stay informed about product updates, new features, and industry trends to effectively support customers and provide relevant guidance and recommendations

developing, and managing cloud-based infrastructure, applications, and
services**. Cloud computing enables organizations to optimize IT resources,
improve scalability, and reduce operational costs.

 **Must-have skills for a cloud engineer**

Cloud engineers in all roles must have proficiency in the following areas:

                              *  **Linux.** Cloud engineers should have a strong understanding of the Linux operating system, which companies frequently use for cloud development. Cloud engineers should understand the architecture, maintenance and administration of Linux servers.
                              *  **Database skills.** Cloud engineers should have cloud database management skills and knowledge of MySQL and Hadoop.
                              *  **Programming.** Cloud engineers should have strong general programming skills, along with knowledge of programming languages such as SQL, Java, Python, Ruby, Golang, PHP and .NET.
                              *  **Networking.** Cloud engineers should understand virtual networks and general network management functions.
                              *  **DevOps.** DevOps is a popular framework for cloud engineering, so having a hands-on understanding of DevOps practices can be valuable to employers. Amazon Web Services (AWS) DevOps in particular is a sought-after skill by cloud providers.
                              *  **Containerization.** Cloud engineers should have proficiency of containerization tools and understand Docker and Kubernetes.
                              *  **Virtualization.** Cloud engineers should have the knowledge to deploy and run application software on virtual machines.
                              *  **Understanding of cloud providers.** As technical cloud features and engineering practices can vary between different service providers, understanding what each offers can enhance a cloud engineer's knowledge and make them more marketable to employers.
                              *  **Security and recovery.** Cloud security is a growing priority among providers and knowledge of cybersecurity in the context of the cloud is a valuable asset.
                              *  **Web services and application programming interfaces (APIs).** Cloud engineers should have knowledge of open standards, such as XML (Extensible Markup Language), SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol), WSDL (Web Services Description Language) and UDDI (Universal Description, Discovery and Integration), and an understanding of how APIs are engineered.

Our people at JLL are shaping the future of real estate for a better world by
combining world class services, advisory and technology to our clients. We are
committed to hiring the best, most talented people in our industry; and we
support them through professional growth, flexibility, and personalized
benefits to manage life in and outside of work. Whether you’ve got deep
experience in commercial real estate, skilled trades, and technology, or
you’re looking to apply your relevant experience to a new industry, we empower
you to shape a brighter way forward so you can thrive professionally and
personally.  
  
The Property Manager performs a broad spectrum role that will challenge you to
confirm that you are effectively managing the property / properties under your
management where you will play the vital role in ensuring that service
delivery expectations are exceeded. This role will test your skills across
areas such as client & tenant relationship management, portfolio management,
team leadership, leasing administration, facilities management and the
financial elements including budgeting and reporting.  
  
What this job involves  
Being the glue that binds  
Working as part of a team and assisting the headquarters portfolio managers,
you’ll play a key role in our delivery of quality property management services
to clients. You’ll drive initiatives that help improve our capabilities in
achieving the highest service levels expected by our clients. You’ll achieve
such an outcome by building strong relationships not only with your team
members, but also with the property’s council members and residents.  
  
Beating the daily grind  
You’ll plan the daily operations and ensure the general maintenance of the
condominium. Preparing and implementing an emergency/crisis management plan
will also be part of handling the operations. Handling daily operations should
be in compliance with the relevant building statutory requirements.  
  
Creating an operation rhythm  
In this role, you’ll ensure that your team gets through the daily grind of
managing condominium properties. Particularly, you’ll be on top of the
planning to achieve optimal daily operations—from the basic stuff to the nitty
gritty details such as emergency/crisis management plan preparation and
rollout. While all these sound like routine on the surface, getting everything
in compliance with the relevant building statutory requirements should keep
things exciting.  
  
Going into the details  
You’ll keep all details in check, specifically in terms of budget and
financial transactions. You need to be on the lookout for the vendors’
intention to renew their contracts, as well as ensure proper delivery of all
their invoices and insurance. You’ll have to be as accurate as possible as you
may have to discuss such details during monthly council and annual general
meetings.  
  
MAJOR RESPONSIBILITIES  
Appraise, train and supervise engineers, supervisors, technicians and other
personnel in maintenance, accounting, admin, as well as control and supervise
other personnel from contract maintenance and services  
Lead the development of the building operational plan and annual budget  
Provide regular report to the management company and the building regarding
status of the building, utilities and services  
Conduct regular meetings with assistants, supervisors and engineers to assure
effective and smooth staff communications and designation of works  
Recommend for approval for the ordering of supplies, materials, equipment and
services ensuring adherence to the approved budget  
Assure that all staff members comply with company and building policies and
procedures  
Implement JLL standards and improvements throughout the building  
Make recommendations to the Real Property Division of the client or client’s
representative regarding operational and key staffing changes  
Discipline staff where necessary within JLL Code of Conduct and the Labor Code  
Administer the lease document between landlord/tenant  
Perform related duties as assigned by Management

tempo work environment, where you can put your strong business, client

At RISE, we use a combination of internally developed IT applications, as well
as external ones. Whenever possible, we aim to use an already built
application from a vendor, and use it to its highest potential; and where
needed, extend and integrate that with our internally built applications to
form a consistent, cohesive information system that accelerates and supports
us in achieving our business goals.

  
We aim to be a software-native company, and automate many of our business
processes, and extensively use data to make the right decisions in real-time.
We want to achieve this through a well-built, extensive information system
that spans across all departments in the company, with a centralized
information dashboard for analysis in supporting business decisions.

  
Our IT Application team is composed of 3 to 5 cross-functional members and is
designed to be complete and responsible for delivering complete applications
within our company. We expect our engineers to be not just writing code, but
to participate in the entire process from investigating problems, designing
solutions, and implementing them into features our staff will love. In
addition, we have a leadership team that is composed of team leads, IT
Managers, Process Managers, IT Operation Managers, that work together in
leading the entire IT department.

  
We use a goal-oriented IT development roadmap to keep all our teams aligned,
which is updated in a weekly cycle by the leadership team. Further, we
maintain a corresponding release plan based on a 6-weeks release cycle, where
we break down initiatives into sizable chunks that our teams can work with as
little inter-team dependency as possible.

  
Our teams apply an agile process of weekly planning, retrospectives, daily
check-in, pair programming, and use Trello to visualize our progress. All our
code is version controlled in Github and all code changes go through a peer-
review process.

  
We have a continuous delivery pipeline, using CircleCI, and perform deployment
using automated tools (CodePipeline and CloudFormation) in our AWS production
site. We built most of our automation tools and we expect all our engineers to
participate in maintaining our development tools, delivery pipelines, and
production sites.

  
Our teams are encouraged to spend time developing their knowledge and skills
so they stay relevant in their field. We have self-initiated learning sessions
and allocate time in weekly sprints for learning activities.
